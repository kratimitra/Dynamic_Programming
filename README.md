# What Is Dynamic Programming 
Dynamic Programming is basically an optimization over recursion.
Recursion leads us to recalculations of some of the subproblems again and again , thus to reduce the overhead time complexity , we may save the results of the subproblems 
into some table so that we may not need to recalculate them and we can easily fetch those results whenever required in the future.


Hereby including some of the standard problems of dynamic programming.
